I was recently annoyed by having the wrong icon for certain files that
should open with Notepad++. <!--more--> You can see the proper icon in the top of
this image, and the incorrect icon in the bottom.

![Wrong file icons in Windows 7 Explorer]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/2014/01/wrong_icons.png)<br /> Wrong file icons in Windows 7 Explorer

The problem was that instead of setting the file association in Notepad++, 
I set it with the "Open With" dialog in Explorer, and Windows chose the 
wrong icon for me.

The solution is to delete the file association and reinstate it properly.
I found the solution on [SuperUser]. Open `regedit` and delete the sub-key
with the same name as the extension with the wrong icon, under the following
keys:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
    
Then, open Notepad++ with admin privileges and add the extension to the "File Exts."
panel. You may need to use the "Customize" field. Finally, open Task Manager 
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>), "End Process" the `explorer.exe`
process, open a New Task from the File, type `explorer.exe`, and you are good to go.
