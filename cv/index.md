Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA  
<http://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu>

Conducting experimental and computational studies of the ignition
properties of several alternative fuels and foundational fuels, with
focus on engine-relevant conditions.
Designing a species sampling apparatus for time-resolved
species measurements in the rapid compression machine, using gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify and quantify
combustion intermediates.
Analyzing kinetic models for combustion to determine the parameters
controlling prediction of ignition delay and improve the ability of
the models to predict combustion events.

In general, my research interests lie in the area of combustion engineering and energy sustainability.

**Lead Chairperson, Junior Associates Committee, 2012--**  
Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center

{:.duties}
Coordinate monthly teleconferences for graduate students
and post-doctoral researchers in the CEFRC where junior members of
the CEFRC present recent research results to the group.
Act as the liasion between the Center's principle investigators
and the junior members.

**EFRC Newsletter Editorial Board Member, 2013--**  
U.S. Department of Energy

{:.duties}
Contributed articles to the newsletter describing recent scientific advances resulting from EFRC research, including:  
["Burning Butanol in a Better Engine"](http://www.energyfrontier.us/newsletter/201210/burning-butanol-better-engine)  
["The Advantage of Renewable Fuels in High-Efficiency Engines"](http://www.energyfrontier.us/newsletter/201401/advantage-renewable-fuels-high-efficiency-engines)  
The audience for the articles is scientifically literate, but not
expert in the fields relevant to each article. Edit articles written 
by other board members for factual and grammatical correctness.
