**UPDATE (10/10/2013):** The newest version of Mendeley (1.10.1) now supports journal abbreviations, so go out there and upgrade! I've also removed the file since it isn't necessary any longer.

Whilst working on my latest journal paper today, I needed to include journal abbreviations in my bibliography. Unfortunately, the software I use to manage my references, Mendeley, does not include a method to automatically abbreviate journal titles in references. Fortunately, there is a workaround.

As detailed in this [forum post](http://support.mendeley.com/customer/portal/questions/179297-how-to-enable-journal-abbreviations-?new=179297), the method is to create a file in the user data folder that Mendeley can read. The following steps worked on Win7, Word 2010, Mendeley 1.5.2:

1. Open the Mendeley Data Folder (`"C:\Users\_Username_\AppData\Local\Mendeley Ltd\Mendeley Desktop"`) or by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> in Mendeley. The keyboard shortcut opens the Debug dialog, simply click "Open Data Folder"
2. Create a folder called `journalAbbreviations`
3. Create a file in that folder called `default.txt`
4. Put the journal then the abbreviation separated by a tab so:<br>
Proceedings of the Combustion Institute <kbd>TAB</kbd> Proc. Combust. Inst.

Also, other users have invented much more complicated ways of getting the journal abbreviations file: <a href="http://alexchubaty.com/node/15">http://alexchubaty.com/node/15</a>

Finally, your citation style must be set up to use abbreviated journal names - not all of them are, and some that should be aren't. The fix is simple: in the CSL file add the `form="short"` attribute to the `<text>` tag containing your `variable="container-title"`. More about editing CSL for Mendeley can be found by <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mendeley+edit+citation+styles">googling</a>. I might do a post about more CSL stuff later.
