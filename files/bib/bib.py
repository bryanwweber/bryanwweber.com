#Take BibTeX bibliography and export citations in the format of my
#website, bryanwweber.com. The format of the output is kramdown, and
#is intended to be included in a file to be processed by Jekyll. The
#BibTeX file is expected to be from Mendeley, although Mendeley follows
#the standard conventions pretty well, so most BibTeX files should 
#work. bibtexparser is Python 3 ONLY!
#
#v. 0.1.0 - initial release
#v. 0.1.1 - Fix escape character bug in annote field. Add help output
#           with option -h. 14-OCT-2013
#v. 0.2.0 - Add option to specify highlighted author name on the 
#           command line input, -a. 04-NOV-2013
